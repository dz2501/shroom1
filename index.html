        <h1>The Third Kingdom</h1>
        <p1>In common parlance the term 'mushroom' is applied to an edible fungus and the term 'toadstool' to an inedible or poisonous fungus. In both cases we are referring to 
            'macro-fungi', and it should be pointed out that 'micro-fungi' fulfill a function in nature that is even more important in the life of man. It is to this microscopic universe that belong yeasts and ferments, parasites which ravage crops, moulds which decay foodstuffs, paper and hide, countless agents of disease but also numerous antibiotics. However, these micro-fungi are not the subject of this book, and the term 'fungi' will be used as a synonym for 'mushrooms and toadstools'. 
            Such a vast group, containing about 100,000 species, offers so wide a variety of structures, that their systematic classification and the determination of their phylogenic or evolutionary history have given rise to many difficulties. 
            Fungi are traditionally considered as plants, but are really quite distinct: they are therefore known sometimes as the 'Third Kingdom'. They have no chlorophyll, roots, stems or leaves and hardly resemble any true plant. They also have several features found in the animal kingdom, besides numerous features characteristic of themselves alone. 
            With the exception of the more primitive forms, which are unicellular, the typical fungi are composed of a more or less compact tangle of fine filaments, which is called a mycelium. These filaments, the hyphae, branch out into the materials from which they derive their nutrition. 
            The absence of chlorophyll prevents fungi from exploiting directly the carbon contained iô€€• the atmosphere, as green plants generally do. In order to live and grow, therefore, the mycelium must procure for itself organic substances produced by other organisms. 
            One way by which fungi may be classified is their mode of nutrition. First there are the simple saprophytes, which live on dead or decomposing organic matter such as manure, dry leaves and humus. Parasites, on the other</p1>
